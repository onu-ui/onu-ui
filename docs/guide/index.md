# What is Onu UI?

Onu UI is an atomic UI library based on UnoCSS and a component library in the Vue ecosystem.

The core is opinionated and all components are generated by pure atomicity css, which is fast, flexible, and highly free to mix and match.

## <i i-carbon-document-word-processor-reference /> Intro

Onu UI provides a large number of atomic components, you can use Onu UI in any framework supported by UnoCSS, such as Vue, React, Svelte, etc.

Onu UI also lightweight, it only exists in your development dependencies and will not increase your production package size. It includes a comprehensive and beautifully prebuilt component suite to help you quickly build web applications.

It is beautifully designed, provides theme variants and rules for easy style overrides, and supports dynamic theme color generation, generating a color system that conforms to human visual perception by [`Magicolor`](https://github.com/zyyv/magic-color) and all theme key colors come from it. All-in-One theme configuration makes your theme configuration simpler.

About the Vue components library was written with the latest [Vue3 setup script](https://vuejs.org/guide/typescript/composition-api.html), full of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [Tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) to package and build the component library. In addition, we also embrace the latest front-end ecological cutting-edge technology, thanks to [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/), and the huge Vite plugin ecosystem.

For example:

::: code-group
  ```html [unocss]
  <button btn>Button</button>
  <button btn="~ sm">Button</button>
  ```
  ```vue [vue]
  import { Button } from 'onu-ui'

  <Button>Button</Button>
  <Button size='sm'>Button</Button>
  ```
:::

<button btn>Button</button>
<button ml-2 btn="~ sm">Button</button>

::: warning ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
All components of Onu UI are implemented by UnoCSS shortcuts, which is a pure atomic UI library, and UnoCSS will cache and minimize compression during the matching process, and its performance is extremely high.
